# Economic-Growth-Model



This is an Excel assignment that I did in school for one of my economics classes. In this assignment, I simulate a Solow economic growth model in Excel and show what happens when:

1. the economy is in steady state
2. changing the savings rate to where consumption is maximized
3. doubling the growth rate

The main focus is to get the correct visualizations for the model given the three main topics listed above, as well as understand the model itself by hands on practice. 

Scored out of 150 points, where full points are given to projects that "have no calculation mistakes and are also visually appealing". Scoring is for the excel file as well as a project write up.
My score for the project: 150/150.
