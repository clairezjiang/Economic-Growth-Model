# Economic-Growth-Model



This is an Excel assignment that I did in school for one of my economics classes. In this assignment, I simulate a Solow economic growth model in Excel and show what happens when:

1. the economy is in steady state
2. changing the savings rate to where consumption is maximized
3. doubling the growth rate

The main focus is to get the correct visualizations for the model given the three main topics listed above. 

Scored out of 150 points. I got 150/150.
